# megalaxy_wrapper

Wrapper for MEGA-CC to allow use in Galaxy. Given a fasta, newick, or mega-formatted input file and a MAO (MEGA analysis options) file generated by MEGA's prototyper, will run MEGA-CC through Galaxy's web interface.

## Using on Galaxy

For this tool to be downloadable by a Galaxy admin, the steps described [here](https://galaxyproject.org/toolshed/publish-tool/) must be taken to create an entry for the app in Galaxy's toolshed.

Any time either the MEGA-CC binary is updated or the wrapper is changed, the tool must be manually updated as well.
