# megalaxy_wrapper

Wrapper for MEGA-CC to allow use in Galaxy. Given a fasta, newick, or mega-formatted input file and a MAO (MEGA analysis options) file generated by MEGA's prototyper, will run MEGA-CC through Galaxy's web interface.

### Using on Galaxy

For this tool to be downloadable by a Galaxy admin, the steps described [here](https://galaxyproject.org/toolshed/publish-tool/) must be taken to create an entry for the app in Galaxy's toolshed.

Any time either the MEGA-CC binary is updated or the wrapper is changed, the tool must be manually updated as well. 

### Developing Locally

Follow steps outlined [here.](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/tools/add-tool-tutorial/). In summary, the MEGA-CC binary, tool wrapper, and python filetype ID script need to be placed in a subfolder in Galaxy's tools directory, then the config/tool_conf.xml file in the Galaxy instance needs to be updated to see the tool/wrapper. 

### Additional notes

The tool currently depends on a python script, mega_galaxy_input.py, to identify the filetype of the input file, because Galaxy will assign any input data to a new file with a .dat extension. Currently supports fasta, newick, and MEGA format files.
